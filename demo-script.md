# 2-Minute Demo Script
*Relaxed, approachable tone for video walkthrough*

## [0:00-0:30] Overview Tab
*[Click on Overview tab, pause for visual impact]*

**"Hi there! I want to show you something I've been working on that I think could be genuinely useful for Business Analysts.**

**It's a platform that teaches BAs how to code. Now, I know what you're thinking - why on earth would I want to learn coding? Fair question.**

**Here's the thing - as BAs, we spend a lot of time translating what the business wants into something developers can build. But sometimes things get lost in translation, right?**

*[Gesture at the three main cards]*

**So I built this to help us learn their language. Not to replace developers, but to communicate better with them. To write better requirements, understand technical constraints, and bridge that gap between business and technology."**

## [0:30-1:00] Learning Path Tab  
*[Click Learning Path tab]*

**"Here's how it works - four progressive chapters that build on each other.**

*[Point to each chapter as you speak]*

**We start with HTML - learning how to structure a web page and how user interface requirements translate into actual elements. Then CSS, which is all about styling and making things look professional - crucial for government applications.**

**JavaScript is where it gets really interesting - this is where business logic becomes actual functionality. Where 'the user should be able to add tasks' becomes working code.**

**And finally, backend concepts - understanding how data persistence, security, and system architecture work. The stuff that's often invisible but absolutely critical for enterprise applications.**

*[Point to the progress indicators]*

**The whole journey takes about 100 minutes - manageable chunks that fit around your actual work. And you're building something real throughout - a complete government task management system."**

---

## [1:00-1:30] Code Editor Tab
*[Click Code Editor tab]*

**"This is where the real learning happens. You're looking at actual code - real, working JavaScript that powers the application.**

*[Point to the code on the left]*

**You write this code on the left, and immediately see the results on the right. There's no mystery about what each line does - every piece connects directly to a business requirement.**

*[Point to the preview on the right]*

**This is a working government task management system. We use the Ministry of Silly Walks as our scenario because it keeps things engaging while covering serious enterprise development concepts.**

*[Gesture to the three benefit boxes below]*

**The key thing is immediate feedback. You make a change, you see the result instantly. This helps you understand the connection between requirements and implementation in a way that's just not possible with traditional training."**

---

## [1:30-2:00] Business Context Tab
*[Click Scenario tab]*

**"Here's what makes this different from typical coding tutorials - it's built around a complete business scenario.**

*[Point to the Ministry section]*

**We have real user stories, proper acceptance criteria, stakeholder quotes, and technical constraints. Everything you'd see in an actual project.**

*[Point to the user story example]*

**So when you write 'As a Junior Analyst, I want to add new tasks...' you'll understand exactly what implementation looks like. You'll know what makes a requirement easy to build versus difficult.**

*[Gesture broadly at the whole page]*

**This isn't about becoming a developer - it's about becoming a better Business Analyst. Understanding technical feasibility, writing clearer requirements, and having more productive conversations with development teams.**

**And working with John Cleese and Terry Jones makes the whole experience more enjoyable. Trust me on that one."**

---

## [2:00] End
*[Click "Start Tutorial" button]*

**"If you're ready to see how requirements become working software, give it a try. I think you'll find it genuinely useful."**

*[Screen fades or transitions to the tutorial]*

## Delivery Notes:
- **Pace**: Slightly slower than normal conversation - people need time to absorb what they're seeing
- **Tone**: Self-aware humor, acknowledging the absurdity of teaching BAs to code
- **Pauses**: Let visual elements sink in, especially when switching tabs
- **Gestures**: Point to specific UI elements as you mention them
- **Energy**: Relaxed but enthusiastic - like explaining something interesting to a colleague over coffee

## Recording Tips:
- Use a larger monitor if possible - the demo page is optimized for screen recording
- Each tab fits on one screen (70vh height) - minimal scrolling needed
- The navigation tabs are large and clearly labeled for easy clicking during recording
- Consider recording in 1080p for crisp text readability
