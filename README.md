# BA Development Tutorial Service

An interactive web-based tutorial that teaches Business Analysts the fundamentals of web development by building a real application for the Ministry of Silly Walks.

## 🎯 Purpose

This tutorial service addresses a common challenge in software development: the communication gap between Business Analysts and engineering teams. By teaching BAs the basics of how applications are built, they can:

- Better understand technical constraints and possibilities
- Write more implementable requirements
- Ask informed questions during technical discussions
- Bridge communication between business stakeholders and developers

## 🏛️ The Learning Scenario

Students learn by building a task management system for the **Ministry of Silly Walks**, a fictional UK government department responsible for evaluating silly walk applications. This scenario provides:

- **Realistic context**: Government digital services have specific requirements (accessibility, security, GOV.UK design standards)
- **Relatable users**: Civil servants with varying technical comfort levels
- **Clear business needs**: Task management, workload distribution, status tracking
- **Engaging theme**: Keeps learning fun while covering serious technical concepts

## 🚀 How It Works

### Interactive Learning Approach
- **Step-by-step coding**: BAs write actual code with heavy guidance
- **Immediate feedback**: Code validation and hints system
- **Concept explanations**: Every technical concept explained in BA-friendly terms

- Making interfaces responsive and accessible
- Adding basic user interactions
- Understanding the separation of content and presentation

#### Chapter 3: Backend Fundamentals (APIs and Data Flow)
- What APIs are and how they work
- Creating endpoints that serve business needs
- Understanding data validation and security
- How frontend and backend communicate

#### Chapter 4: Database Integration (Data Persistence)
